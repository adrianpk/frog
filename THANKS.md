## Issues

Thanks to the following people for reporting bugs and feature
requests!

- [Dave Herman](https://github.com/dherman). Early on, Dave submitted
  _many_ helpful bug reports and feature requests. He was willing to
  try Frog instead of a more-obvious alternative. Having an early user
  like that was a great motivation.
